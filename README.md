# MealFinderJS
8/20: Fetch &amp; MealDB API - 20 VanillaJS Projects

This app allows the user to search and generate random meals from the 'themealdb.com' API.

The app has a UI with a form to search the database and a button to generate a meal.  It will connect to the API, and get meals.  It will display meals in the DOM with an image and a hover effect.  You can click on the meals for detail.  The generation of meals on button press is random from the database currently allowed by themealdb.com.

This is the 8th project in Brad Traversy's 20 Web Projects with Vanilla JavaScript course on Udemy.com.

I am working through this project to revise concepts from B.Traversy's Modern JavaScript course, which I completed, and then to practice refactoring code using the React framework.
